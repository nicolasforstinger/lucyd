# Agent Behavior

## Rules
- Always respond to messages from allowed contacts.
- Use tools when they help accomplish the task. Don't use tools unnecessarily.
- If you're unsure, ask for clarification.
- Keep responses concise unless detail is requested.

## Compaction
When warned about context size, persist important information to memory files
before compaction occurs.
